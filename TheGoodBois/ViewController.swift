But I'm a very very SWEET doofus.\n\nCary (Carrot Top aka Care Bear) is a young guy. He's probably maybe only a year and a half old with the energy and vigor of a much younger pup. He loves to play, he loves to bark, he loves to jump up on your face and smother you with drooly kisses. He is NOT a delicate flower, to put it mildly. He would make an AWFUL apartment dog--his bark can be heard several states over. He has the will to climb up on countertops but all the grace and skill of a drunken walrus. If you're looking for a calm companion, we can direct you to several other wonderful, deserving dogs. But if you're looking for a lotta fun and a lotta love and heart of gold, Cary's your guy. This loveable mug is fostering in the Austin area."
